# Lode Runner

A clone of the ZX spectrum version of the famous game.

13 levels available, fully playable.
The enemy AI is smart enough to reach you everywhere provided there exists a path to you.
In the original game the enemies could be tricked and led astray. Here, you'll have to run for your life!

             #-----------|
